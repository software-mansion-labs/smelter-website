A layout component that will resize its children to match its own size. It will always preserve
aspect ratio while resizing.

## Usage

## Positioning
### Absolute

A component is absolutely positioned if it defines fields like top, left, right, bottom, or rotation.
Those fields define the component's position relative to its parent. However, to respect those values,
the parent component has to be a layout component that supports absolute positioning.

- `Rescaler` **does not** support absolute positioning for its child components. A child component will still be rendered, but all fields like `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`, and `rotation` will be ignored.
- `Rescaler` can be absolutely positioned relative to its parent, if the parent component supports it.

### Static

`Rescaler` always have exactly one child that will be proportionally rescaled to match the parent.

## Transitions

On the scene update, a `Rescaler` component will animate between the original state and the new one if the `transition` field is defined. Both the original and the new scene need to define a component with the same `id`. Currently, only some of the fields support animated transitions:

- `width` / `height` - Only supported within the same positioning mode. If the positioning mode changes between the old scene and the new one, the transition will not work.
- `bottom` / `top` / `left` / `right` / `rotation` - Only supports transition when changing a value of the same field. If the old scene defines a `left` field and the new one does not, the transition will not work.

- **Default value**: `"fit"`
- **Supported values**:
    - `"fit"` - Resizes the component to match one dimension of the parent while ensuring it remains fully visible.
    - `"fill"` - Resizes the component to cover the entire area of the parent by matching at least one dimension; excess is clipped.

Vertical alignment.

- **Type**: `"top" | "center" | "bottom" | "justified"`
- **Default value**: `"center"`

---

### width
Width of a component in pixels.

- **Type**: `f32`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `Rescaler` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a [layout component](/fundamentals/concepts/layouts), the `width` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are [layout components](/fundamentals/concepts/layouts), please refer to the relevant component documentation.
</Aside>

---

### height
Height of a component in pixels.

- **Type**: `f32`

The behavior of the `Rescaler` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:

</Aside>

---

### top
Specifies the distance in pixels from the top edge of this component to the top edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### left
Specifies the distance in pixels from the left edge of this component to the left edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### bottom
Specifies the distance in pixels from the bottom edge of this component to the bottom edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### right
Specifies the distance in pixels from the right edge of this component to the right edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### rotation
Specifies the rotation of a component, measured in degrees. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `f32`

---

### transition
Defines how this component will behave during a scene update. This will only have an effect if the previous scene already contained a `Rescaler` component with the same id.
- **Type**: [`Transition`](#transition-1)

---

### border_radius
Radius of a rounded corner.

- **Type**: `f32`
- **Default value**: `0.0`

## Transition
```typescript
type Transition = {
  duration_ms: f64;
  easing_function?: EasingFunction;
  should_interrupt?: boolean;
}
```
### Properties

#### duration_ms
Duration of a transition in milliseconds.

- **Type**: `f64`

---

#### easing_function
Easing functions are used to interpolate between two values over time during transition. 

- **Type**: [`EasingFunction`](#easingfunction)
- **Default value**: `"linear"`

---

#### should_interrupt
If `true`, on scene update a transition that is already in progress will be interrupted and a new transition will start from the current state.

- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Default value**: `false`

## BoxShadow
```typescript
type BoxShadow = {
  offset_x?: f32;
  offset_y?: f32;
  color?: string;
  blur_radius?: f32;
}
```
### Properties

#### offset_x
Specifies the horizontal offset on the x-axis. Positive values move the element to the right, negative values move it to the left.

- **Type**: `f32`
- **Default value**: `0.0`

---

#### offset_y
Specifies the vertical offset on the y-axis. Positive values move the element downward, negative values move it upward.

- **Type**: `f32`
- **Default value**: `0.0`

---

#### color
Color in a `"#RRGGBBAA"` format.

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default value**: `#FFFFFFFF`

---

#### blur_radius
Defines the radius of the blur effect.

- **Type**: `f32`
- **Default value**: `0.0`

## EasingFunction
```typescript
type EasingFunction = 
  | { function_name: "linear"; }
  | { function_name: "bounce"; }
  | {
      function_name: "cubic_bezier";
      points: [f64, f64, f64, f64];
    }
```
Easing functions are used to interpolate between two values over time.

Custom easing functions can be implemented with cubic Bézier.
The control points are defined with `points` field by providing four numerical values: `x1`, `y1`, `x2` and `y2`. The `x1` and `x2` values have to be in the range `[0; 1]`. The cubic Bézier result is clamped to the range `[0; 1]`.
You can find example control point configurations [here](https://easings.net/).

### Properties

#### function_name
Duration of a transition in milliseconds.

- **Type**: `linear | bounce | cubic_bezier`
- **Default value**: `linear`
- **Supported values**:
    - `linear`
    - `bounce`
    - `cubic_bezier`
---

#### points
Four numerical values in `[0; 1]` range used for cubic Bézier. The result is clamped to the range `[0; 1]`.

- **Type**: `[f64, f64, f64, f64]`
