## Properties

### width
Width of a component in pixels.

- **Type**: `number`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `View` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a layout component, the `width` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are layout components, please refer to the relevant component documentation.
</Aside>

---

### height
Height of a component in pixels.

- **Type**: `number`

<Aside type='caution'>
The behavior of the `View` component varies depending on the type of its parent component:
- **Non-layout parent** - When the parent is not a layout component, the `height` property is **required**.
- **Layout parent** - For parents that are layout components, please refer to the relevant component documentation.
</Aside>

---

### direction
Defines how static children are positioned inside a View component.

- **Type**: `"row" | "column"`
- **Default value**: `"row"`
- **Supported values**:
    - `"row"` - Children are positioned from left to right.
    - `"column"` - Children are positioned from top to bottom.

---

### top
Specifies the distance in pixels from the top edge of a component to the top edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### right
Specifies the distance in pixels from the right edge of a component to the right edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### bottom
Specifies the distance in pixels from the bottom edge of a component to the bottom edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### left
Specifies the distance in pixels from the left edge of a component to the left edge of its parent component. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### padding
Specifies the padding for each side of a component.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### paddingVertical
Specifies the padding for the top and bottom side of a component.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### paddingHorizontal
Specifies the padding for the left and right side of a component.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### paddingTop
Specifies the padding for the top side of a component.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### paddingBottom
Specifies the padding for the bottom side of a component.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### paddingLeft
Specifies the padding for the left side of a component.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### paddingRight
Specifies the padding for the right side of a component.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### rotation
Specifies the rotation of a component, measured in degrees. If this attribute is set, the element will be positioned absolutely, overriding any layout constraints imposed by its parent.

- **Type**: `number`

---

### overflow
Controls the behaviour of the content exceeding the area size.

- **Type**: `"visible" | "hidden" | "fit"`
- **Default value**: `"hidden"`
- **Supported values**:
    - `"visible"` - Render everything, including content that extends beyond their parent.
    - `"hidden"` - Render only parts of the children that are inside their parent area.
    - `"fit"` - If children components are too big to fit inside the parent, resize everything inside to fit.

<Aside>When using `fit`, components with unknown sizes are treated as if they had a size of 0 when calculating the scaling factor.</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">`fit` will resize everything inside the parent, including absolutely positioned elements.</Aside>

---

### backgroundColor
Background color in `#RRGGBBAA` or `#RRGGBB` format.

- **Type**: `string`
- **Default value**: `#00000000`
